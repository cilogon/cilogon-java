    <![CDATA[In order to manage the serial strings there needs to be some
mechanism that ensures that serial numbers are created uniquely and in order.
This is done in SQL databases with a reserved table and in other stores with
other mechanisms. This store therefore really should not be used for any
direct operations, but should use the supplied commands. Note that there are
no properties for this.]]>

    <![CDATA[Command.
Increment the counter to the next value. The store may be configured to skip
values (so couting by 5's, not 1's).]]>

    <![CDATA[Command.
Resets the store to start with 0 or 1 (depending on the back machinery).
This is a drastic move! If   you have active users then resetting the counter
means that you will re-use serial numbers and the result will be invalid X509 certs.
The intent is that in cases where there are issues setting up the counter (at installation)
this is an easy way to reset the counter before actually adding any users.]]>
